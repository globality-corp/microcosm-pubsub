    a message and commit a persistent transaction, message consumers are expected to call back to source-of-truth
    (e.g. via HTTP) and fetch the current resource value. In the event that message has not been committed yet,
    the consumer can retry a few times before giving up (e.g. via SQS dead-lettering).

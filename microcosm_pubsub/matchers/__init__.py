"""
Hamcrest-style matchers for PubSub messages.

Note that this package depends on `PyHamcrest`, which is intentionally not an
installation dependency of `microcosm-pubsub` (but is a test dependnency).

Users are expected to install `PyHamcrest` as a test dependency and import
this package as part of their unit tests (and not their runtime).
